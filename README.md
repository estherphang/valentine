# About

I thought I would do something fun this year (2024) to ask my boyfriend to be my Valentine. I saw a similar application on social media, and I thought, 'Hey, why not build this and tweak it for our special occasion?' Moreover, I am in the midst of my boot camp and taking it as a chance to practice.

If you have a crush or a partner and you would like to ask him/her to be your Valentine, feel free to fork a copy and edit to your preference.

## Installation

To install the app, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
